# Quiz

Welcome to `React`, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Our goal for this unit is to learn and build apps using component-based design through React.js. Not only will we provide you with the knowledge necessary to build a React application, but also the conventions and best practices that create sustainable code. Lessons and lesson order are subject to change at any time depending on our progress in club meetings.

Lecture notes are provided in each section as a markdown file (README.md) or as a pdf.

## Course Structure

Every odd week, we will present a lesson and tackle it with the traditional HTML-CSS tech stack. Then, every other week, we will present a React.js version of that less. You will receive the best of both worlds and will come out with a greater understanding of how the two synergize.
